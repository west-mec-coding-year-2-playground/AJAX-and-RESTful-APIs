# About
In this project, you will create use a PHP script as a proxy to fetch market information for a stock based on a stock symbol that a user specifies.

## Instructions
In this Exercise, we will learn how to open files from a web server. we will also learn how to retrieve dynamic data from the server to update the client application. We will make use of AJAX to accomplish this.

1.	Copy all of the completed files from `Project01` into the `Projects/Project_Lab/www` folder; this will contain all of the files you will zip up and submit. Open all of the necessary files in your IDE and complete the documentation at the top.
 
2.	Go to the JavaScript file script.js. At the bottom of the file, add the global variable httpRequest and set its value to false. Create a second global named entry with a text value of “^IXIC”:
```js
/* global variables */
var httpRequest = false;
var entry = "^IXIC";
```
3.	Directly below that, create a function named `getRequestObject()`. Fill the function with a try / catch structure to create an XHR object. Add an alert() that we will use to test the function:
```js
    try {
        httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    }
    catch (requestError) {
        return false;
    }
    alert(httpRequest);
    return httpRequest;
```
4.	Let’s set up a test for this by setting up a temporary event handler for the page load event. At the bottom of the file, create the following code:
```js
if (window.addEventListener) {
    window.addEventListener("load", getRequestObject, false);
} 
else if (window.attachEvent) {
    window.attachEvent("onload", getRequestObject);
}
```

Let’s move the code and do a server test. Page load should trigger an alert() showing a valid XHR object.
 
5.	To stop any default submission from executing, let’s build a function to stop it below the `getRequestObject()` function, with an alert() test:
```js
function stopSubmission(evt) {
    alert("stopSubmission()");
    if (evt.preventDefault) {
        evt.preventDefault();
    }
    else {
        evt.returnValue = false;
    }
}
```
6.	Let’s modify our event handler creation code to call that function as an event handler on the submit event:

```js
var form = document.getElementsByTagName("form")[0];
if (form.addEventListener) {
    form.addEventListener("submit", stopSubmission, false);
    window.addEventListener("load", getRequestObject, false);
} 
else if (form.attachEvent) {
    form.attachEvent("onsubmit", stopSubmission);
    window.attachEvent("onload", getRequestObject);
}
```

Let’s do a server test for syntax and to make sure that both our load event and submit event are acting correctly.

7.	Now let’s start to build out a function that will request stock quote data from the server. It will use the stock symbol the user enters in the `<input>` field, or the default if nothing is entered. We will start it by having it create our XHR object if necessary, or re-use it if already created. Below stopSubmission() enter:

```js
function getQuote() {
    alert("getQuote()");
    if (document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value) {
        entry = document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value;
    }
    if (!httpRequest) {
        httpRequest = getRequestObject();
    }
}
```

8.	To test this, let’s first call the function at the bottom of our stopSubmission
```js
() function:
    getQuote();
```
9.	Let’s also modify our load event to use it as an event handler instead of `getRequestObject()`:
```js
var form = document.getElementsByTagName("form")[0];
if (form.addEventListener) {
    form.addEventListener("submit", stopSubmission, false);
    window.addEventListener("load", getQuote, false);
} 
else if (form.attachEvent) {
    form.attachEvent("onsubmit", stopSubmission);
    window.attachEvent("onload", getQuote);
}
```
Now we can do a server test on both the load event, which should produce a getQuote() alert and a valid XHR object alert. The submit event. Should produce a `stopSubmission()` alert and a `getQuote()` alert. If everything looks good let’s remove all of the debug alerts from the code and go on to conquer new ground.

10.	We can now prepare our `getQuote()` function to generate our AJAX request:
```js
    httpRequest.abort();
    httpRequest.open("get", "StockCheck.php?t=" + entry, true);
    httpRequest.send(null);
```

A browser test with Developer Tools will be required to see some results. Go to the Network tab. We should see a Request URL that is properly formed and has our default stock symbol ^IXIC attached. Now type in Microsoft’s MSFT and it should show that Submit produces the right results.

11.	Now we need to get our data, so we need to set our onreadystatechange event handler:

```js
    httpRequest.onreadystatechange = displayData;
```

12.	Let’s start to build out the `displayData()` event handler below `getQuote()`. First we will see if we can get data back, before we attempt to start placing that data on the page with the DOM:

```js
function displayData() {
    if (httpRequest.readyState === 4 && httpRequest.status === 200) {
        var stockResults = httpRequest.responseText;
        console.log(stockResults);
     }
}
```

A server test with Developer Tools in the Console tab should let us test. Make sure there are no syntax errors. We should get good console.log() data. Now let’s try it with a stock symbol of MSFT.

13.	Now let’s start to format that data so that we can get it into the DOM and onto the page. At the bottom of the if statement, first remove the debug console.log(). Now, let’s format the text string that we got in from responseText. First, we will split that string into subarrays with a JavaScript `Array.split()` method and a regular expression that will split it based on the commas and quotes. We will console.log() the result:

```js
        var stockItems = stockResults.split(/,|\"/);
        console.log(stockItems);
```

In the Console tab, expand the array. You will notice that it looks weird. We get empty strings as elements, mixed with the data converted to strings as elements. We purposely set up the regular expression to do that, to split on both commas and quotes. This has the effect of taking any quote it finds and making it into a string element, and taking the data inside it and enclosing it in quotes. Any data it finds not in quotes, it puts into quotes. So all the data is now strings, even the data that was numeric. This makes it easier for us to deal with to place into the DOM elements.
 
14.	Now let’s get rid of those empty strings. To do this we will use a for loop with a JavaScript Array.splice() method. It specifies the array position to remove it from, and how many elements to remove. We will console.log() the result:

```js
        for (var i = stockItems.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (stockItems[i] === "") {
                stockItems.splice(i, 1);
            }
        }
        console.log(stockItems);
```

In the Console tab, expand the new array. If everything is correct, we now have the empty strings removed, and the rest of the data is still there, set up as string elements in the modified array. If we are good to go, remove the three console.log() debug statements.

15.	Now let’s see if we can get some data onto the page by placing it into the DOM nodes. We will start with a single element by placing the following code directly below the for loop:
```js
        document.getElementById("ticker").innerHTML = stockItems[0];
```

A server test should give us the stock symbol in the right place.

16.	Now let’s get the rest of the data up on the page by pulling the rest of the array elements and placing them in the DOM nodes:
```js
        document.getElementById("openingPrice").innerHTML = 
            stockItems[6];
        document.getElementById("lastTrade").innerHTML = 
            stockItems[1];
        document.getElementById("lastTradeDT").innerHTML = 
            stockItems[2] + ", " + stockItems[3];
        document.getElementById("change").innerHTML = stockItems[4];
        document.getElementById("range").innerHTML = (stockItems[8] 
            * 1).toFixed(2) + " &ndash; " + (stockItems[7] * 1).toFixed(2);
        document.getElementById("volume").innerHTML = (stockItems[9] 
            * 1).toLocaleString();
```

The ^IXIC symbol will give us data for the entire NASDAQ. If we try it for MSFT, the data should make sense.
 

17.	Now let’s get a little better style into the stock data. To do that, we will build a formatTable() function directly below displayData():

```js
function formatTable() {
    var rows = document.getElementsByTagName("tr");
    for (var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
        rows[i].style.background = "#9FE098";
    }
}
```

18.	Now we need to add this as an event handler to be triggered by the load event. Add the following code to our event handler setup area:
```js
if (form.addEventListener) {
    form.addEventListener("submit", stopSubmission, false);
    window.addEventListener("load", formatTable, false);
    window.addEventListener("load", getQuote, false);
} 
else if (form.attachEvent) {
    form.attachEvent("onsubmit", stopSubmission);
    window.attachEvent("onload", formatTable);
    window.attachEvent("onload", getQuote);
}
```

Let’s give this a server test, and we should get a good effect.

19.	Now let’s make sure our data is up to date when the site is active. We can do this with a setTimeout() code sequence to refresh every 10 seconds. We will use a console.log() debug statement to make sure it’s working. Add the following code to the top of getQuote():
```js
    console.log("getQuote()");
Add the following sequence to the bottom of getQuote():
    clearTimeout(updateQuote);
    var updateQuote = setTimeout('getQuote()', 10000);
```

Let’s give this a server test. If it is working remove the console.log() debug and it is a wrap.

## Step 2

Project 01_11_03
As you have seen the Stock quote program that we built is not working correctly. In this project, you will modify the code from the previous project to use a completely different Web service.
   

1.	Copy all of the completed files from Project 01_11_02 into a Project 01_11_03 folder; this will contain all of the files you will zip up and submit. Open the stocks.html file and change the <h1> content as follows:
```js
   <header>
      <h1>
         Project 01_11_03
      </h1>
   </header>
```

2.	Let’s debug the project. Open op the scrtipt.js file and change the documentation to Project 01_11_03. Go to the displayData() function and place the console.log() debug back into the code as follows:

```js
function displayData() {
    if (httpRequest.readyState === 4 && httpRequest.status === 200) {
        var stockResults = httpRequest.responseText;
        console.log(stockResults);
     }
}
```

A server test with Developer Tools in the Console tab should let us test. Make sure there are no syntax errors. The console.log() data should show us that we got garbage, a mess of HTML.

3.	So are we actually getting data in from the server? Let’s put the following debug code into displayData() to monitor or readyState and status to see how the AJAX executes:

```js
function displayData() {
    console.log("httpRequest.readyState: " + httpRequest.readyState);
    console.log("httpRequest.status: " + httpRequest.status);
```
In a server test, it appears that our readyState climbs directly through the proper values and gives us successful status. But we get a garbage response.

4.	Has something changed with Yahoo Finance? That would certainly not be unusual. Google “yahoo finance quotes api” to see what we can find. Sure enough, in the results we find a “Bye Yahoo, and thanks for all the fish – The Financial Hacker” category. Click on that and let’s see what we see. Wow “aargh!” and welcome to the life of a coder. The API has disappeared.

5.	Let’s see if we can find another API to use for stock quotes. Google “yahoo finance quotes api replace” to see what we can find. In the results we find a “Replacing Yahoo Finance with the IEX API and Alpha Vantage” category. Click on that and we get a couple of choices. Click on the “Alpha Vantage API” link and let’s look it over. Ok, free, JSON format, needs an API key. Let’s look at the documentation. Looks good, but lots of API categories, and the endpoints look a little complex, but a definite possibility.

6.	Let’s look at the other one. Click on the “IEX” link and let’s look it over. Simple menu on the left, so we click on endpoints. Says that all endpoints are prefixed with:

`https://api.iextrading.com/1.0`

Also says supports JSON and there is no mention of an API key. So far, so good.

7.	Let’s click on the Stocks option and see what is available. First thing it tells us is to “use the /ref-data/symbols endpoint to find the symbols that we support” which sounds pretty simple. Let’s go into StockCheck.php and copy lines 4 & 5 to make some changes and just test this API as follows:
```js
//header("Content-Type: text/csv");
//$Quote = "http://quote.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=$TickerSymbol&f=
    sl1d1t1c1p2ohgv";
header("Content-Type: application/json");
$Quote = "https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/ref-data/symbols";
```

Give this a server test and we have some clean JSON with stock symbols.

8.	Let’s do some further experimentation in Stocks and see what kind of data we can get that meets the needs of our Website. Scroll down past Batch Requests and we see some options under Book. It further tells us that we can get responses from quote and give it a stock symbol. Let’s check it out by clicking on it. The explanation and JSON look like just what we need. Change the StockCheck.php endpoint as follows:
$Quote = 
    "https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/$TickerSymbol/quote";
Let’s give that a server test. It appears that we get a status 404.If we look at the request, we see a weird looking symbol. Seems to indicate our symbol is not found.
9.	The symbol ^IXIC is bogus; it is for Yahoo, indicating we don’t want an individual stock, we want the whole market. Not supported by IEX. Let’s make a change to Microsoft in our global variables in script.js:
/* global variables */
var httpRequest = false;
var entry = "MSFT";
This appears to work based on or Console data. So we go to the boss, and tell him about Yahoo. Tell him not to worry, we now have much more data. We show him and say we are going to improve the Website, and of course charge some more.
 
10.	For starters, let’s get our starting stock into the search box. Go to the getQuote() function, and let’s add an else statement to originally populate the control:
function getQuote() {
    if (document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value) {
        entry = document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value;
    }
    else {
        document.getElementsByTagName("input")[0].value = entry;
    }
Go to displayData() and let’s remove our readyState and status debug and give this a test. The search box should populate.
11.	We can see that our response is a string representation of JSON. Let’s convert that to JavaScript JSON so we can use it. We change the array.split() function to a JSON.parse(). We will also remove the for loop that formats an array, we don’t need it anymore. Lastly, let’s console.log() our converted string:
        var stockResults = httpRequest.responseText;
        console.log(stockResults);
        var stockItems = JSON.parse(stockResults);
        console.log(stockItems.symbol);
        document.getElementById("ticker").innerHTML = stockItems[0];
Now we have clean JavaScript JSON to work with.
12.	Let’s populate our first data field for a test as follows:
        console.log(stockItems.symbol);
        document.getElementById("ticker").innerHTML = stockItems.symbol;
Give it a test and it is working well.
 
14.	Let’s get the rest of the data as follows:
        document.getElementById("ticker").innerHTML = stockItems.symbol;
        document.getElementById("openingPrice").innerHTML = 
            stockItems.open;
        document.getElementById("lastTrade").innerHTML = 
            stockItems.latestPrice;
        var date = new Date(stockItems.latestUpdate);
        document.getElementById("lastTradeDT").innerHTML = 
            date.toDateString() + "<br>" + date.toLocaleTimeString();
        document.getElementById("change").innerHTML = 
            (stockItems.latestPrice - stockItems.open).toFixed(2);
        document.getElementById("range").innerHTML = "Low  " + 
            (stockItems.low * 1).toFixed(2) + "<br>High " + 
            (stockItems.high * 1).toFixed(2);
        document.getElementById("volume").innerHTML = 
            (stockItems.latestVolume * 1).toLocaleString();
Give this a test. When it works, remove the debug.
15.	Lastly, let’s cite IEX as required in their Terms of Use. Add the following to stocks.html:

```html
                <input type="submit" value="Get Quote" />
                <br><br>
                 <p>
                    Data provided for free by 
                    <a href="https://iextrading.com/developer/">IEX</a>
                </p>
                 <p>
                    View 
                    <a href="https://iextrading.com/api-exhibit-a/">
                        IEX’s Terms of Use</a>
                </p>
```
Give this a final test, and it appears that it is a wrap.
